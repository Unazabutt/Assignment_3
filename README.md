Okay, here's a route suggestion for your $1500 load from Dallas to New York, keeping in mind the 1500-mile distance, mild weather, and current market conditions:

**Suggested Route:**

*   **Dallas, TX to Memphis, TN (Approx. 630 miles):**
    *   Take I-30 East to I-40 East.
    *   *Why this way?* This is a major freight corridor. You should find decent fuel prices and rest stops.

*   **Memphis, TN to Charleston, WV (Approx. 530 miles):**
    *   Continue on I-40 East to I-81 North, then I-64 East
    *   *Why this way?* A good spot to rest before entering the final route.

*   **Charleston, WV to New York, NY (Approx. 470 miles):**
    *   Take I-79 North to I-76 East (Pennsylvania Turnpike), then I-78 East to New York.
    *   *Why this way?* While the Pennsylvania Turnpike has tolls, it is generally a faster and well-maintained route to New York.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Tolls:** Be prepared for tolls, especially on the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-76). Factor these into your cost calculations.
*   **Traffic:** Traffic around major cities like Memphis and near New York can be heavy, especially during peak hours. Plan accordingly.
*   **Rest Stops:** Plan your rest stops in advance, especially if you have specific requirements (e.g., truck stops with showers, specific fuel brands).

**Alternative Route Considerations (If you want to avoid tolls):**

*   From Charleston, WV, you could take I-68 East to I-70 East to I-76 East (through Pennsylvania, avoiding the PA Turnpike for a portion). This will add time to your trip.

**Market Conditions:**

*   Keep an eye on load boards in Memphis, Charleston, and Pennsylvania. You might find opportunities for backhauls or partial loads to maximize your earnings.

**Before you go:**

*   Double-check weather forecasts.
*   Confirm your load details and delivery schedule.
*   Ensure your truck is in good working order.

Safe travels! Let me know if you have any other questions or want me to refine this route further.
