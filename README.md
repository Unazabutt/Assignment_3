Okay, a $1500 load from Dallas to New York is a good start! 1500 miles is a haul, but with mild weather, we can plan a smooth trip.

Given the distance and the current market, let's aim for efficiency. Instead of going directly through the heartland, which can sometimes be congested, consider this:

*   **Route Suggestion:** I recommend taking I-20 E to I-59 N, then transition to I-75 N towards I-81 N, and finally I-84 E into New York.
*   **Reasoning:** This route avoids major city centers like Chicago or Indianapolis, which could save you time and potential delays. I-81 and I-84 are major trucking corridors, so you'll find plenty of truck stops and services.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Tolls:** Be aware of tolls along I-81 and I-84, especially as you get closer to New York.
*   **Traffic:** Keep an eye on real-time traffic conditions, particularly around major cities like Harrisburg, PA, and Scranton, PA, on I-81. Use apps like Google Maps or Waze for live updates.
*   **Hours of Service:** Plan your stops carefully to comply with Hours of Service regulations.
*   **Fuel Prices:** Monitor fuel prices along the route. Prices tend to be higher in the Northeast, so consider fueling up in Pennsylvania or even Ohio if you find better deals.

**Alternative Strategy:**

If you are open to it, consider breaking the trip into two shorter hauls. Instead of going directly to New York, you could look for a load from Dallas to somewhere like Atlanta or Charlotte, and then find another load from there to New York. This could potentially increase your earnings, as shorter routes tend to pay more per mile in high-demand areas.

Safe travels, and let me know if you have any more questions!
